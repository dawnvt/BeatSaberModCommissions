# BeatSaberModCommissions
Repo for any and all pricing and commission info

## Pricing and Terms of Service
* My mods have a flat rate of US$15 an hour - Some mods take longer, others may be simple fixes
  * I will always round to the nearest hour after the second hour.
* I reserve the right to deny any mods I think are too complex for me.
* Updates to mods are not guaranteed, but I will try to update the mods that people have commissioned me for.

## Past work
