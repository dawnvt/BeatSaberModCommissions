# BeatSaberModCommissions
Repo for any and all pricing and commission info

## Pricing and Terms of Service
* My mods have a flat rate of US$15 an hour - Some mods take longer, others may be simple fixes
  * I will always round to the nearest hour after the second hour.
* I reserve the right to deny any mods I think are too complex for me.
* Updates to mods are not guaranteed, but I will try to update the mods that people have commissioned me for.
* All mods will by default be open source, meaning they will be on my GitHub (The website youre on right now) for anyone to improve upon it.
  * Should you want to make the mod closed source, I would need a good reasoning behind it.
* Mods will be using the GNU GPL v3 license, unless specified otherwise.

## Past work
