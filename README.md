# Beat Saber Mod Commission Info
Repo for any and all pricing and commission info

## Pricing and Terms of Service
* My mods have a flat rate of US$20 an hour - Some mods take longer, others may be simple fixes
  * I will always round to the nearest hour after the first hour has gone by.
* I reserve the right to deny any mods I think are too complex for me.
* Updates to mods are not guaranteed, but I will try to update the mods that people have commissioned me for.
* All mods will by default be open source, meaning they will be on my GitHub (The website youre on right now) for anyone to improve upon it.
  * Should you want to make the mod closed source, I would need a good reasoning behind it.
* Mods will be using the GNU GPL v3 license, unless specified otherwise.

## Past work
* [ScoreRequirement](https://github.com/dawnvt/scorerequirement) - Disable score submission by toggling 5 individual requirements and limits
* [CustomMenuPointers](https://github.com/dawnvt/custommenupointers) - Custom menu pointers! (Currently only loads Saber Factory sabers.)

# Web Development Info

## Work in Progress

## General clauses
* If you need the mod or web app quickly, that will add 15% of the products value to the final price.
* I reserve the right to cancel the commission if you act like a nuisance to me, or hurry me without specifying a rushed commission.

## Payment
* Payment will be done through PayPal only - I will do an estimate of how complex the work is, and give you a general estimate time wise before I start working.
  * Note: This ***will*** be somewhat inaccurate, and you will have to wait for the final estimate for the final price.
